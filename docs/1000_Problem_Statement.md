# Project: Melora - A Personal Music Player for iOS

## 1. Vision & Purpose

This project aims to develop a personal, ad-free music streaming application for iOS, inspired by the core functionality of Spotify. The primary goal is educational: to gain hands-on experience in mobile application development, audio streaming, and building a feature-rich user interface. This application is intended strictly for personal use and will not be distributed, so there are no copyright concerns.

## 2. Target Platform

The application will be developed exclusively for the iOS platform, targeting a personal iPhone device.

## 3. Core Features

The application will implement the following key features to provide a robust music listening experience.

### 3.1. Audio Playback & System Integration

-   **Background Audio:** The app will continue to play audio when it is in the background or when the device is locked.
-   **Lock Screen & Control Center Integration:** Users will be able to control music playback (play, pause, skip forward/backward) directly from the iOS lock screen and Control Center. Album art and track information should also be visible.
-   **Standard Playback Controls:** The UI will feature standard controls including a play/pause button, next and previous track buttons, and a seekable progress bar.

### 3.2. Music Library Management

-   **Local Music Library:** The application will manage a library of audio files stored locally on the device. An initial implementation will involve pre-loading the app with a selection of personal, copyright-free audio files for testing and development.
-   **Song Metadata:** The app will parse and display metadata for each track, such as title, artist, album, and album art.

### 3.3. Playlist Management

-   **Create & Manage Playlists:** Users can create new playlists, give them custom names, and delete them.
-   **Add & Remove Songs:** Users will be able to add any song from their library to one or more playlists. They will also be able to remove songs from a playlist.
-   **View Playlists:** A dedicated section of the app will display all created playlists and the songs within them.

### 3.4. Search Functionality

-   **Library-wide Search:** A search feature will allow users to quickly find songs within their music library.
-   **Search by Metadata:** The search should be able to filter results based on song title, artist name, or album.

## 4. User Interface & User Experience (UI/UX)

-   **Now Playing View:** A visually appealing screen that displays the current track's information (album art, title, artist), playback controls, and progress.
-   **Tab-based Navigation:** A simple navigation structure (e.g., Library, Search, Playlists) to allow for easy discovery and access to features.
-   **Intuitive Design:** The overall design will be clean, modern, and easy to navigate, drawing inspiration from popular music streaming apps.

## 5. Future Enhancements (Optional)

-   **Queue Management:** Ability to see and reorder the upcoming songs in the playback queue.
-   **Advanced Audio Features:** Implementation of an audio equalizer, crossfade functionality, etc.
-   **Lyrics Display:** The ability to show synchronized lyrics for the currently playing song.
