I am creating a clone of Spotify so that i can listen to music ad free and can also learn from it at the same time. 

It is purely for learning purpose and will not be uploaded anywhere, so no need to worry about copy right issues.

I want to build it soleley for my personal iphone and use it from there.

I want these spotify like features in my app.

- controlling from action centre and even when the phone is locked
- creating playlists
- searching for songs and adding them to my playlists
- other features etc..
